I created a tic-tac-toe game in Python! It's a well-known game where players place their pieces on a 3x3 board, taking turns. The objective is to get three pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

In addition, the game has a function to draw who starts playing, and you can play against a friend or against the computer. The game is all in text, so you have to type your move in the terminal.

Although it looks simple, tic-tac-toe is full of strategy and can be quite fun.
